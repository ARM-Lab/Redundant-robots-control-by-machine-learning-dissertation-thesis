# Redundant Robots Control by Machine Learning – Dissertation Thesis

Welcome to the official repository for the dissertation thesis **"Redundant Robots Control by Machine Learning"**.

This repository contains the following resources:

- 📄 **Dissertation Thesis** – Full PDF document of the thesis.
- 🛠️ **CAD Files** – Mechanical design files for the experimental testing bench.
- 📊 **Open-Source Dataset** – Dataset collected from a continuum robot setup, suitable for machine learning research and benchmarking.
- 💻 **Source Code** – Scripts for training.

## Overview

The goal of this thesis is to explore and develop machine learning approaches for the control of redundant robotic systems, with a particular focus on continuum robots. Redundant robots possess more degrees of freedom than are strictly necessary for a given task, making traditional control strategies challenging. This work investigates data-driven methods to overcome these challenges.
